# 99 problems [Scala]

This is an attempt to create solutions for the problems at http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

The website contains its own solutions, this is only for the sake of practice. Solutions in this project may not be optimal or it may use built-in constructs while the site proposes fully recursive/tail-recursive alternatives. 

Be aware that the website is relatively old and it may propose deprecated API methods for some solutions. Also, there are several problems missing in the site (for example, no P42)

Exercises that want to check performance (like P38) by comparing execution times are ignored (it's not my aim when doing this)

Exercises (like Tree) that require extending one class have been modified to implement a method that receives that class as parameter. The reason is to avoid mixing code and to keep one problem per file 

All in all, a good way to sharpen my Scala skills :)


## Current status

All problems up to problem 54 are solved. Problem 55 in progress. This is quite time consuming as the second half of the list includes lengthy problems, so it will be completed slowly
